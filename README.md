Project name: Fit.io

Description: The Fit.io app will allow a user to plan, track, and manage workouts as well as improve their strength by providing a suggested weight increase based on user input of a rate of perceived effort (RPE) after each set of reps. Users can also see workout history and metrics to gauge their progress. 

Installation: Workout App is available exclusively on Android mobile devices.

Usage: Once installed, a user creates an account and logs in. After a successful login, they can build a workout and track their progess as they complete each exercise. After each exercise set, the user can enter their RPE which will be used by the app to suggest weight changes for the next workout. The user can also view their workout history in a chart based screen.
